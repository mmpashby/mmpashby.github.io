# About Me

Hi, I am Mark, an IT/Tech Vet with 20+ years experience in various technical and leadership disciplines. I am a literal bag of stardust, living one chemical reaction to the next.

I am an engineer at heart with a passion for security, data and any science related subjects. A big geek, with an appreciation for pop culture nerd humour. An amateur cryptologist with a great passion for the history of cryptography, in-fact I am a friend and patron of Bletchley Park.

**What Is This Blog For?**

As you can probably tell, I am a terrible writer. I need to practice, and to do that, I need a blog to keep me committed to writing articles that some of you may find interesting.

**What I Do?**

- Question all the things. Always question all the things.
- Furious Yak Shaving.
- Collect metrics from everything, even Humans.
- Fix all the things. In legacy and not so legacy environments.
- Build all the things. CI/CD Pipelines, cloud platforms and neat elastic band creations.
- Code all the things. I use Python and Golang as my tools of choice. I have authored/contributed to many internal tooling projects in my career, which means I'm down with Developer Experience......apparently.

**Passions:**

- Comedy. I like jokes.
- Films/TV Shows.
- Science.
- Reading.
- Travelling.
