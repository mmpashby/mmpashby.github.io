# Hello World

Hello :wave:, so, this is the new home for my blog. I have moved the blog from AWS to Github Pages, behind Cloudflare. 

**Why?** mainly cost, £300+ a year for hosting it in AWS, vs £0 on Github Pages behind Cloudflare.

**What?** to celebrate my almost 23 years in tech (16 years professionally), I will be doing a series of blog posts, with a two week cadence, covering all sorts of topics that will hopefully be useful to some people out there.

I hope you enjoy the content and keep coming back :)
